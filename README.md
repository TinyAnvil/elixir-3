# Elixir 3: Sane Responsive Images

Elixir 1 was originally a Statamic-only PHP add-on which eventually got smarter and smarter and finally moved out into the Javascript world allowing it to be used anywhere and everywhere regardless of CMS.

I've been selling Elixir since its inception but have decided to open source the project in the interest of giving everyone complete access and make it easier to support.

I never really made much $$ off it and there are a few other solutions out there to choose from so rather then take it down I'm setting up shop here.
